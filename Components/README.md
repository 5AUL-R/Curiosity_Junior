# Component selection 

## Drive motors  
Only two wheels need to be driven.  
Perhaps 360 degreee servos as they have a very easy shape to design for?
Possibly [these ones?](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1579.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwmMX4BRAAEiwA-zM4JgweX5YrlIlS2uMyACAoAOzD38arsTbhuKU2fgW3WwFYDpsSVQBSdRoCx-8QAvD_BwE)

## Steering Motors
Four wheels will need drive for steering - (Or two minimum if four proves too difficult).  
Again, seems like servos may be the go? 

## Batteries  
This depends very much on the motors selected - TBD  

## Microcontroller  
Probably just an Arduino Uno
## Additional electronics  
- Motor driver board
- Pravin mentioned he wanted an ultrasonic proximity sensor attatched to a servo
